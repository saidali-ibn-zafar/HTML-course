<h2>Apple Company</h2>
<br>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership.[6][9] The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.[10] To finance its creation, Jobs sold his Volkswagen Bus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator.[11]: 57 [a] Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[12] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal computer.[13] It went on sale soon after debut for US$666.66 (equivalent to $3,175 in 2021).[14][15]: 180  Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked "repeating digits".[16]</p>
<p>Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[17][18] without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded Apple.[19] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of US$250,000 (equivalent to $1,117,930 in 2021) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.[20] During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.[21]</p>

<h3>2007–2011: Success with mobile devices</h3>
<p>During his keynote speech at the Macworld Expo on January 9, 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would thereafter be known as "Apple Inc.", because the company had shifted its emphasis from computers to consumer electronics.[107] This event also saw the announcement of the iPhone[108] and the Apple TV.[109] The company sold 270,000 iPhone units during the first 30 hours of sales,[110] and the device was called "a game changer for the industry".[111]</p>
<p>In an article posted on Apple's website on February 6, 2007, Jobs wrote that Apple would be willing to sell music on the iTunes Store without digital rights management (DRM), thereby allowing tracks to be played on third-party players, if record labels would agree to drop the technology.[112] On April 2, 2007, Apple and EMI jointly announced the removal of DRM technology from EMI's catalog in the iTunes Store, effective in May 2007.[113] Other record labels eventually followed suit and Apple published a press release in January 2009 to announce that all songs on the iTunes Store are available without their FairPlay DRM.[114]</p>
